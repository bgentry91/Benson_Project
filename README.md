# README

For our first project at Metis, we were assigned the task of optimizing the placement of street teams at the entrance of NYC subway stations. These teams were to collect e-mail addresses for those who were interested in attending a gala held by “WomenTechWomenYes” (WYWT). At the conclusion of the project, we were to present our findings and recommendations.

In order to accomplish this, we collected data from the MTA turnstile dataset, which is a relatively “dirty” dataset of the entries and exits at each individual turnstile that the MTA manages. The entry and exit data is collected roughly every four hours (with some extra and missing).
